# Linux

Why learn linux?  Simple.  Somewhere between 70-90% of all servers on the internet run linux.  In addition, there are 1.5 Billion devices (yes Billion) that run the Android operating system, which is linux based.  Oh, and BTW, Mac's run a version (Darwin) of linux too!  If you are interested in the internet, networking, web development, security or mobile devices, it behooves you to know about linux.

# Environment
In order to play with linux we'll set up a development environment that can be easily replicated and, more importantly, trashed if something gets messed up.

## VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.  You can download and install it from the (VirtualBox Download Page)[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads].

## Vagrant
Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environments. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases development/production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.  You can download and install it from the (Download Vagrant Page)[https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html].
